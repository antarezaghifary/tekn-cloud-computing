##### What is the difference between IaaS, SaaS, and Paas?

**SaaS: Software as a Service**

It simply means running applications at public clouds. The user uses these apps via the Internet. These apps are maintained by the Service Provider. Some e.g., of Service Providers, are SalesForce, Microsoft(Office 365), Oracle, Google(Google Apps), etc.

Salesforce was the first company to transform the world of Saas, and from that point, other companies have seen potential in this market and launched their apps.

**Iaas: Infrastructure as a Service**

It provides an environment for developers to build applications that users can use. IaaS includes:-

Users create virtual machines (VMs) on demand.
From a library of VM images.
Amazon (AWS) is a leading vendor in providing IaaS.

**PaaS: Platform as a Service**

This is somewhat similar to IaaS but the difference is:

Developers provide an application which the platform runs.
They donâ€™t directly create VMs.
